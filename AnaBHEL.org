** AnaBHEL Description :Intro:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 640
#+CAPTION: Schematic layout of the AnaBHEL experiment. On the left is where we would receive the expected red shifted Hawking IR photon, and the partner mode would be on the other side which an XUV single photon detector is used. The signal photon pair are extracted from vacuum, therefore entangled and polarization anticorrelated.

*** First thin film @ NEMS Facility
Goal: To get familiar with superconducting thin film growing, measure the superconductivity in a cryogenic system. I plan to grow a 300nm Nb film on top of SiO_{2} substrate using the sputter machine at NEMS facility.cite:NEMS_official

* Device Fabrication
Here are the needed fabrication and experiment steps for building SNSPD. Many parts is inspired of the work from Glasgow University group, and modified to the equipment we have here.

We have two options:
1. Get 50% discount everytime we use.
2. Get us a period of free operation time

Estimate cost for one thin film : 1k NTD
