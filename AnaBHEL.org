** AnaBHEL Description :Intro:

The motivation for us to start developing this detector is to detect polarized Infra-red single photons. In the AnaBHEL experiment cite:chenAcceleratingPlasmaMirrors2017 proposed by Pisin Chen and Gerard Mourou, a plasma wakefield is produced by a strong laser plus supersonic gas jet. The longitudinal density profile (along the laser axis) of the gas jet should be tuned to have a steep gradient, so that plasma wakefield phase velocity would go through a large acceleration. The plasma wakefield is like a mirror with low reflectivity (~10^-4, should add reference here), and when it is under large acceleration there is a possibility that it could pull out vacuum quantum fluctuation photon pairs! This effect is analogous to the famous Hawking evaporation cite:hawkingParticleCreationBlack1975 produced in the black hole scenerio. If one of the photon of the vacuum flluctuation photon pair gets reflected by the plasma wakefield mirror, and one doesn't, then the vacuum photon pair won't go back to vacuum. The reflected photon would go througn a red shift, similar to the Hawking radiation case, resulting at sub-ev level ( Infra-red region ). The photon partner would never catch up the plasma mirror, just like the Hawking partner trapped by the black hole. However in the AnaBHEL case there is an interesting different, the partner mode would penetrate whenever the wakefield collapse at the edge of the gas jet, resulting to be a detectable photon, and because this photon wouldn't go through red shift, the energy scale is differernt to the reflected photon (or we could say the Hawking photon). This effect induced a requirement to set up a detector system for single photon pairs, which are time correlated, polarization correlated, back to back in space, energy scale at different level, one targeting at the mid infra-red region ( 1-10um ), the other targeting at visible light to soft UV region.

#+CAPTION: Schematic layout of the AnaBHEL experiment. On the left is where we would receive the expected red shifted Hawking IR photon, and the partner mode would be on the other side which an XUV single photon detector is used. The signal photon pair are extracted from vacuum, therefore entangled and polarization anticorrelated.
